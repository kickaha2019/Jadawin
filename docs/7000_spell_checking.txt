@title Spell checking
@text
If the key `spell_checking` is specified 
in the [configuration](1500_Configuration)
it is taken as a directory containing 
`*.txt` files of words. Generation of the
HTML webpages will include spell checking
in this case.

There is one word per line. If the word is all
lowercase the matching is case insensitive.
If the word contains uppercase characters then
the matching is case sensitive.

Any words not in the `*.txt` files will be
listed to the file given by the
key `misspelt_words` in the
[configuration](1500_Configuration).

The spell checking code makes an effort to
replace some HTML entity codes with
ASCII letters for instance `Andr&eacute;` will
be spell checked as `Andre`.
