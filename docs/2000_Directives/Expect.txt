@text
The *@expect* directive adds a test for the HTML
is generated. The first line following the `@expect`
describes the test, the second line gives a regular
expression which should find a match in the
generated HTML. So an example test that no spaces should appear
in Apple*Banana*`Cherry`[Date](2000_Directives/Text)Elderberry.

@code
  @expect
  Superfluous spaces should not be added
  Apple<EM>Banana</EM><SPAN CLASS="code">Cherry</SPAN><A HREF="Text.html">Date</A>Elderberry

@expect
Superfluous spaces should not be added
Apple<EM>Banana</EM><SPAN CLASS="code">Cherry</SPAN><A HREF="Text.html">Date</A>Elderberry

@text
The test can be made negative by prefixing the 
regular expression with `! `. So to test
that Gremlins don't appear on this page when generated
the following would work:

@code
  @expect
  Gremlins should not appear on this page
  ! Gremlins

@expect
Goblins should not appear on this page
! Goblins
