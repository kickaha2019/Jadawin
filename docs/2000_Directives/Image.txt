@text
The *@image* directive specifies an image to be displayed
centered in large format on a page.
So the code:

@code
  @image		../apple.jpg

@image		../apple.jpg
@text
displays a picture of an apple on this page.

The image filenames in the *@icon*, *@image*, *@inset*, and *@gallery*
directives are relative to the page filename they're in, unless they
start with a */* in which case they're relative to the root of the
website.

An enhancement is allowing options to be specified 
by appending ";..." to the end of the image filename. So
appending ";top" to a filename will cause thumbnails to
be taken from the top of the image rather than the middle.

@expect
Images specified by @image should be displayed on page
<IMG.*SRC="../apple-\d+-\d+-\d+\.webp".*<P>displays a picture

@error
No filename given for image
Image missing image name
@image
@text
