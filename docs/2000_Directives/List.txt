@text
The *@list* directive can generate two kinds of list.
If the rows which follow the directive have two fields
separated by a '|' character a 2-column table 
is generated where the headings
are in the first column. As an example:

@code
  @list
  Fruit|Apple
  Colour|Green
  Taste|Tangy
  Size|Small
  Shape|Round
  
@text
will give:

@list
Fruit|Apple
Colour|Green
Taste|Tangy
Size|Small
Shape|Round

@expect
Keyword / value list expected from @list declaration
<TABLE CLASS="table">\s*<TR>\s*<TD STYLE="font-weight: bold; text-align: left">\s*Fruit\s*</TD>\s*<TD STYLE="text-align: left">\s*Apple\s*</TD>

@text
If there is only one field on each line following the 
directive then @list generates a bullet point list,
for example

@code
  @list
  Fruit
  Colour
  Taste
  Size
  Shape

@text
will give:

@list
Fruit
Colour
Taste
Size
Shape

@expect
Bullet point list expected from @list declaration
<UL>\s*<LI>\s*Fruit\s*</LI>
