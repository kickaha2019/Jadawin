@text
By default the image displayed for a page in a link to that
page is the first image that can be found on that page, or on
a child page.

The *@icon* directive can be used to override the link image used,
or have a link image where there is no image on the page itself.

So for example
the [Events style child page](Events_style/AAAA) source file has:

@code
  @icon ../../apple.jpg

@text
in it. The apple image appears on the 
[Events style](Events_style) page
but not the child page itself.

@error
No filename given for icon
Icon missing image name
@icon
@text
