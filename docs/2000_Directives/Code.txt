The *@code* directive gives a block of preformatted text
to be displayed on a webpage. So for example the code:

@code
    @code
    This is an example of using @code.
  
@text
gives

@code
This is an example of using @code.

@text
Special characters are replaced by HTML entity codes in
code sections.

@code
< > and & are the special characters

@text
If the lines in a *@code* section seem to be 
similarly indented that indentation is removed.
This is a fudge so a *@code* section can 
list page source examples yet not have unnecessary
spaces in the generated page.

@expect
Common indentation should be removed in @code sections
<PRE CLASS="code">@code
@expect
The @code directive should display preformatted text
<PRE CLASS="code">This is an example of using @code\.\s*</PRE>
@expect
Special characters should be replaced in @code sections
<PRE CLASS="code">&lt; &gt; and &amp; are the special characters\s*</PRE>
