@text
The *@gallery* directive generates a thumbnail gallery on a page
where the thumbnails can be clicked on to show a larger version of the
image.

So for example
the [gallery example](8000_Examples/Gallery) source file has:

@code
  @gallery
  ../../apple.jpg This is an apple
  ../../avocado.jpg Do you like avocados?
  ../../guava.jpg It's a guava
  ../../lemon.jpg I like lemonade
  ../../orange.jpg  Naranja in Spanish

@text
The images to display in the gallery are listed one per line after
the *@gallery* directive, with a description of the image following
the image filename.
