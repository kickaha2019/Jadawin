@text
The *@inset* directive specifies an image to be displayed
in small format on a page, floated to right or left so text wraps around it.
So the code:

@code
  @inset		../apple.jpg
  
@inset		../apple.jpg
@text
causes a picture of an apple to be inset into this
paragraph.

@error
No filename given for inset
Inset missing image name
@inset
