@text
The *@inset* directive specifies an image to be displayed
in small format on a page, floated to right or left so text wraps around it.
So the code:

@code
  @inset		../apple.jpg
  
@inset		../apple.jpg
@text
causes a picture of an apple to be inset into this
paragraph.

@list
Blank lines are added if necessary to avoid the inset image intruding on later page elements.

@expect
Images specified by @inset should be inset into following text
<IMG.*SRC="../apple-\d+-\d+-\d+-centre\.webp".*<P>causes a picture
@expect
Blank lines should be inserted to allow for inset images
<P>causes a picture of an apple to be inset into this\s*paragraph\.\s*<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></P>

@error
No filename given for inset
Inset missing image name
@inset
@text
