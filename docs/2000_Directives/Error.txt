@text
The *@error* directive adds a test that following
directives on a source file raise an expected error.
The first line following the `@error`
describes the expected error, the second line gives 
the expected error text.

So an expected error is that hidden pages should be
in the root directory of the source files.
In [Hidden style](8000_Examples/Hidden_style/hidden)
there is an @error test:

@code
  @error
  Hidden page must be at root of website
  Hidden page must be at root of website
