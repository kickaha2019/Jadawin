@text
The *@error* directive adds a test that following
directives on a source file raise an expected error.
The first line following the `@error`
describes the expected error, the second line gives 
the expected error text.

So an expected error is that date declarations like:

@code
  @date xxx

@text
should give an error. In
[Date](2000_Directives/Date)
there is an @error test:

@code
  @error
  Bad date
  Bad date [xxx]
  @date     xxx
