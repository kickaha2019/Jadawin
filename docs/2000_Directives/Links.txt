@text
The *@links* directive generates a list of 
references to pages containing a *@tag*
directive for the specified name.

So putting the code:

@code
  @tag A_TAG_NAME
  
@text
in a page will cause that page to appear as a child
of another page which has:

@code
  @links A_TAG_NAME
  
@text 
in it. For any given tag name there can only be one
occurrence of a `@links` statement.

@error
Unknown tag for links
Unknown tag: zzz2
@links  zzz2
