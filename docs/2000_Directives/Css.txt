@css
.to, .t1, h1 {color: lime}

@text
The *@css* directive declares what follows is CSS code
to be embedded as is into the header of the generated page.

So the code:
@code
  @css
  .to, .t1, h1 {color: lime}
  
@text
causes the text on this page to appear in lime not yellow.

@expect
The @css directive should embed CSS code into page header
.to, .t1, h1 {color: lime}.*</style>\s*</HEAD>
