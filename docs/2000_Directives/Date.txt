@text
The *@date* directive assigns a date to a page. If a date is specified it will
appear at the top of the webpage (if there is any content on the page).

So for example the code:
@code
  @date		Sunday, 24 June 1901

@text
causes this page to have `Sunday, 24 June 1901` appear at the
top. Assigning dates to pages is important for
the order of indexes on pages with certain styles. 

If the date is in the future the page will not 
appear in the generated website.

The date parsing is simplistic: a number above 1800 is taken as
a year, a number in the range 1 to 31 is taken as a day,
and a text string starting with a 3-letter month name
(case insensitive) is taken as a month.

@expect
