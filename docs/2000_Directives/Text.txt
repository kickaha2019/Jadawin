@text
The *@text* directive declares what follows up to the
next directive is text to be rendered onto the page.
Blank lines result in new paragraphs.

Surrounding text with &ast;s causes the text to be 
emphasized so

@expect
Blank lines should result in new paragraphs
Blank lines result in new paragraphs.\s*</P><P>

@code
*asterisk*

@expect
* delimited text should be emphasized
<EM>asterisk</EM>

@text
gives *asterisk*. Surrounding text with &grave;s causes the 
text to be displayed as code so

@code
`grave`

@expect
` delimited text should be code style
<SPAN CLASS="code">grave</SPAN>

@text
is displayed as `grave`. Links can be embedded into the
text by using `[link text](link URL)` or
just `[link text]` if a link URL has already been
(uniquely) defined for the link text. So

@code
[This page](2000_Directives/Text)

@expect
Insite links should give <A> expressions
<A HREF="Text.html">This page</A>

@text
gives [This page](2000_Directives/Text). If the link is
offsite then it will be forced to open in a new
tab or window in the browser, for example
[Apple](https://apple.com/) will open in a new tab
in *Safari*. If the link URL contains a *)* 
it will need currently to be replaced by a *&rpar;*
HTML entity code.

@expect
Offsite links should give <A> expressions opening in a new tabe
<A HREF="https://apple.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Apple</A>

@text
< and > in normal text will be replaced by HTML entity codes but not &amp;. 
*< and > escaped by &ast;s will be replaced by HTML entity codes but not &amp;.*
[&amp; will not be replaced by HTML entity codes &lt; and &gt; are not allowed](2000_Directives/Text).
`< > and & escaped by grave characters will be replaced by HTML entity codes.`

@expect
< > should be escaped in normal text
&lt; and &gt; in normal text will be replaced by HTML entity codes but not &amp;.
@expect
< > should be escaped in emphasized text
<EM>&lt; and &gt; escaped by &ast;s will be replaced by HTML entity codes but not &amp;.</EM>
@expect
< > & should be escaped in code text
<SPAN CLASS="code">&lt; &gt; and &amp; escaped by grave characters will be replaced by HTML entity codes.</SPAN>

@text
Spell checking will be done for normal text,
for *emphasized text*, and for
[link text](2000_Directives/Text), but not for
`grave escaped text`.
