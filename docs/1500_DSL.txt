@text
The HTML pages are defined in `.txt` source files using
a simple DSL (domain specific language). The DSL
consists of directives with data. Each directive
is of the form `@_verb_` at the start of lines.
Data for the directive can either be following on
the same line or on subsequent lines until the
next directive.

So a title for the page can be defined as:

@code
  @title Title for page
  
@text
or as:

@code
  @title
  Title for page

@text
A special directive `@style` controls how the
HTML page looks, particularly for how index
pages are rendered.
