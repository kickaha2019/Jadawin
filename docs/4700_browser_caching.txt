@title Optimisation: browser caching
@text
One can ask browsers to cache images which
rarely change to speed up page accesses.

See *Browser caching* in 
[Dreamhost knowledge base](https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216363157-Cache-a-website-with-an-htaccess-file). Editing the *.htaccess* file 
badly will break a website.
