@title Optimisation: inlining CSS
@text
There is an [AMP](https://amp.dev/) HTML framework originally
from [Google](https://google.com/) concerned with
website usability particularly on mobiles. To push people towards
this framework *Google* include 
[Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/) as a dev tool inside
their *Chrome* browser.

To blindly follow what such tools recommend is not 
sensible. Everything depends on the website and who
uses it. But one *Lighthouse* change I have made is to inline the CSS
for my personal website. This should improve the speed
accessing uncached pages for the website, and the cost
of adding a few thousand bytes of CSS should not be 
major. This isn't so true if a webpage contains
100KBs of inline CSS, that is just penalising anyone
looking at more than a single page. But that isn't my situation.

The *Liquid* templating code strives to only 
inline CSS required for each page.
