@title Ruby implementation
@text
Currently Ruby code is used to generate the HTML files from
the source text files. The [ruby-vips](https://rubygems.org/gems/ruby-vips)
Ruby gem is used for image manipulation, and the
[Liquid](https://rubygems.org/gems/liquid/)
Ruby gem is used for the HTML templates.

The top-level Ruby script is *Compiler.rb*, it needs three
arguments:

@list
Source file directory
Configuration file (see [configuration](/2750_Configuration))
HTML target directory (must exist)

@text
(There is a potential fourth argument for debugging purposes).

The Ruby code maintains a special file `_images.yaml` in the
source file directory which
caches information about the image files there. This file will
be regenerated if deleted.

The following Bash script will build the Jadawin documentation
into HTML files in a `html` folder:

@code
gem install bundler ruby-vips liquid
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=ruby/Gemfile;export BUNDLE_GEMFILE
mkdir html
bundle exec ruby ruby/Compiler.rb docs config.yaml html
