@title Image handling
@text
The source directory contains full size images which
need to be scaled and cropped as part of the website
generation. For speed the dimensions of the full size
images are cached together with the timestamp of the
image.

The [ruby-vips](https://github.com/libvips/ruby-vips) 
Ruby gem is used for image manipulation.

`.webp` image files are generated from the source
`.jpeg` and `.png` images. This format is significantly
more compact (websites can be 25% less bytes in size).

In galleries and index pages using thumbnails it is
visually better that the thumbnails are all the same
dimensions. Sometimes the default centre cropping is
not best so it is possible to annotate the image
references in the source `.md` files to change this.
An example annotation which will force the apple
image to be cropped to the top:

@code
  @gallery
  apple.jpg;top Apple image cropped to top in gallery thumbnail
  
@text
Available annotations

@table
Annotation|Direction
None|Centre (default)
`;bottom`|Bottom
`;left`|Left
`;right`|Right
`;top`|Top

Some of the pictures on this website are taken on a mobile phone. If the
phone was held in portrait mode the images were coming out on the website
rotated wrongly. Looking at the images on the computer didn't show the
problem because the programs handled the rotation behind the scenes.

The image handling code has to allow for this, for
*JPEG* images this involves checking the 
`exif-ifd0-Orientation` value in the `EXIF` metadata.

In addition the *ImageMagick* option `auto-orient` (see 
[auto orient](https://legacy.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.php?#auto-orient))
is used so when the images are resized for use on the website the
rotation is allowed for.
