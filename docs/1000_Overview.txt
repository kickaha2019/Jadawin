@text
These pages document a static website generator
which generates HTML pages from source files in
a directory structure. The structure of the
generated website reflects that directory structure.
Website content is defined in text files with
file extension `.txt`. The
directory structure also contains image files
for images to display.

The text files contain [directives](2000_Directives)
which define the page appearance, the text for the
page is defined using a simplified 
[markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) syntax.

Contents of the source directory structure:

@table
File / directory|Usage
`404.txt`|Page to display for 404 errors - this requires statements in `.htaccess` file or equivalent
`**/*.txt`|Source for HTML pages
`**/*.png`|Image files
`**/*.jpg`|Image files
`**/*.jpeg`|Image files

@text
Files and
directories starting with the `_` character are ignored.

Style sheets for the generated HTML files are
included inline rather than being in separate CSS files.
See [browser caching](4700_browser_caching) for
more details on this.
