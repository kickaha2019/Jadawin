Pure CSS is used to vary the look of the generated webpages
according to the screen acreage available. What is varied is
the size of text and certain divs, the size of images used, and
the logo used at the top of the webpage.

*Jadawin* supports four different page sizes. These page sizes
are defined in the [configuration file](1500_Configuration),
as an array of width and heights for the `dimensions/browser`
key. The `CSS` code uses media queries to change the
look and feel based on the actual page width.
